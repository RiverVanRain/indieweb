# OpenWeb Icons (a font!)

Why OpenWeb Icons? Because Font Awesome had no RSS-icon and a font with only one icon would be a bit boring... Besides, I'm an advocate of the Open Web! Be proud of using Open Web Standards and show it to the world!

The OpenWeb Icons is a web-font that gives you scalable vector icons/logos of some open communities, standards or projects. It includes the Creative Commons-, HTML5- and Microformats-icons for example.

* &gt; 220 Icons - The OpenWeb Icons Font includes Icons of 219 open projects and standards... and a monkey!
* Scalable - Use the font is infinitely scaleable and looks beautiful in any size.
* Colorable - Change the color of an icon with CSS.
* Customizable - The styles are generated with SASS and can easily be customized.
* No JavaScript - The Icon-Font is compatible with all modern Browsers (IE > 7) without the use of JavaScript.
